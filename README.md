## What is it?
A bookkeeping web application

## Motivation
I've used a few bookkeeping applications (QuickBooks, Tally, Wave, etc) over the years and there's always been something missing. It isn't easy and straightforward to use or is limited in some way. Some training is usually required for users. I want to build something that's super easy and fun for anyone to use and with as few restrictions as possible.

Wave's application came closest to what I think a bookkeeping app should be. The great thing was that it was also free and initially available for everyone until they limited it to Canada and the United States. They also apparently recommend switching to Zoho Books.

I've wanted to build a bookkeeping application for years but never felt I had enough skills to do it and still don't. I've never built a full application on my own and I want to do that but perhaps it takes a team so I'm open to contributors.
